# __Connecting the World's Nutrient Banks__

Water markets are broken. In the United States, 50% of water bodies are impaired by nutrient pollution.

The Environmental Protection Agency estimates it will take 700 years of future water remediation to correct existing damage.   

Its clear - traditional nutrient trading markets fail to address global concerns. 

It's time to harness the power of web3 to [#DefendTheWatershed](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DefendTheWatershed&src=typed_query).

## **We're connecting YOU to the world's nutrient banks.**

NeptuneChain is on a mission to help communities avoid water quality catastrophes by building radically new systems for pollution removal and intuitive economies around water. 

Addressing risks in centralized markets requires a structural transformation leveraging decentralized solutions to authenticate trades, eliminate bad actors, and facilitate transactions between trusted parties. 

We're building an ecosystem for farmers and landowners to establish nutrient banks and earn rewards for their work with web3 to drive down pollutants, support farmers and landowners, and streamline transactions for aggregators.

## __FAQ__

#### __What is nutrient trading?__

    Nutrient trading aims to do for water what emissions trading has done for air pollution. NeptuneChain aims to drive down pollutants, primarily agricultural "nutrients" (such as nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium), by helping emitters trade credits and find the most cost-efficient way to remove pollution in our marketplace. Since our formation in 2021, the NeptuneChain team has grown out of a passion for climate action and the common aim of connecting with fellow environmental stewards to create a network of regenerative nutrient banks across North America. The size of the water quality crisis, including the heightened demand for security, the rapidly aging nature of water infrastructure, and the opacity of traditional water markets, make it imperative that NeptuneChain's commitment to harnessing web3 to achieve water quality - both in principle and in practice - be formalized.

#### __How will blockchain help?__

    Governments and enterprise-level businesses have benefitted from traditional opaque nutrient trading markets - but our waters and communities have not. Centralized registries represent a significant security risk that demands decentralized solutions to authenticate trades, eliminate bad actors, and facilitate transactions between trusted parties. 

#### __How big is the problem?__

    Across the world, water quality has suffered from widespread discharging, improper wastewater management, and runoff, leaving our watersheds defenseless and putting our communities at risk. In the United States today, over 3,500,000 acres of lakes and reservoirs are impaired by nutrient pollution. Nearly 80% of our coastal water exhibits overgrowth of algae, which can lead to large hypoxic (low-oxygen) areas similar to the 5,052 square mile area off Louisiana - amassing the entire state of Connecticut. Despite the attention from local, state, and federal entities, an EPA study reconfirmed the drastic state of water quality in North America, finding that "it will take about 700 years to achieve full restoration of currently-impaired waterbodies." In Tennessee alone, nutrients impair nearly 3,000 river miles and more than 15,000 acres of lakes and reservoirs. Industrialism has increased ecological pressures, but our communities don't need to suffer. Nutrient trading aims to do for water what emissions trading has done for air pollution. Whereas 350 parts per million (ppm) is the agreed-upon "safe" level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the agreed-upon "safe" level for drinking water is 10 parts per million (ppm).

#### __What are we building?__

    Marketplace: We're building a simple, transparent, and secure marketplace on the polygon blockchain to enhance deal coordination for trusted parties. You can own verified nutrient offsets with the click of a button. 

    Ecosystem: We coordinate with farmers, customers, and leading climate fellows to build proven nutrient-reduction frameworks and collaborate to prevent market failure. 

    Direct Land Revitalization: We transform land into well-maintained nutrient banks to increase the quality of life, bringing new jobs to disadvantaged communities while simultaneously reducing ecological pressures. Our revitalization efforts aim to provide upfront funding for early-stage nutrient banks.

    Auction House + Brokerage Arm: We streamline transactions for aggregators and large businesses with specific needs to accelerate international market growth and alleviate the burdens of traditional tools. Our decentralized auction house seamlessly hosts English, sealed, and Dutch auctions for anyone to accelerate the price of pollution and generate demand in voluntary markets.
